# AVR firmware for BMP280 wireless sensor (nRF24L01+)

## Features

1. Wireless sensor firmware for ATMega168/328 microcontrollers with BMP280 temperature and pressure sensor.
2. Power consumption in sleep mode approximately 5 uA using Power-down mode.
3. Transmits device identifier, battery voltage, temperature, and pressure readings on each measurement cycle.
4. Battery measurement through internal ADC with 1.1 V bandgap reference.
5. Wake-up from Power-down mode by watchdog timer interrupt with ~8 second interval.
6. Supports ATMega168, ATMega168P, ATMega168PB, ATMega328, ATMega328P, and ATMega328PB.
7. Hardware TWI (I2C) for BMP280 communication on PORTC pins PC4 (SDA) and PC5 (SCL).

## Attention

1. A compatible RF Gateway is required to receive and process transmitted packets.
2. Changing gateway address or channel requires reflashing the microcontroller.
3. The watchdog timer interval is fixed at ~8 seconds; the sensor transmits every 38 ticks (~5 minutes).

## Using

In an existing PlatformIO project, run the following command to install the firmware:

```bash
cd your_project
git clone https://github.com/aZholtikov/zh_avr_bmp280_sensor
```
